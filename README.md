# Windows 10 Landing-Page

Windows 10 is my favourite version of Windows. I created a modified version of my laptop landing page.

## Inspiration

After months of practicing Javascript, I will build four new projects and this is the first.
I start from the landing page of the laptop up to three other Windows page . This page is the first User interface when i boot my device. 
Hopefully, the final 4 would include a framework. Bootsrap or Vue JsðŸ‘€
